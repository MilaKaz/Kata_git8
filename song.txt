I'm a troubled man
I'm changed by the things I do
True, but it's funny how they all remember you
It all could be different
Try to do something new
I've given everything
I want to be a happy man, too
Gotta understand
Blamed by the friends I lose
Who's getting out of hand
To think they depend on you?
It all could be different
Try to do something new
I've given everything
I want to be a happy man too
Buy yourself a dream, how's it looking?
Buy yourself a car and a house to live in
Get yourself a girl, someone different
Buy yourself a dream, and it won't mean nothing

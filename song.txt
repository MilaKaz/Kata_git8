I'm a troubled man
I'm changed by the things I do
True, but it's funny how they all remember you
It all could be different
Try to do something new
I've given everything
I want to be a happy man, too
Gotta understand
Blamed by the friends I lose
Who's getting out of hand
To think they depend on you?
It all could be different
Try to do something new
I've given everything
I want to be a happy man too
Buy yourself a dream, how's it looking?
Buy yourself a car and a house to live in
Get yourself a girl, someone different
Buy yourself a dream, and it won't mean nothing

Gonna run it 'round, strange, but it just won't do, no
When it's coming down, taking a hold on you
It all could be different, try to do something new
Given everything, I want to be a happy man, too
Buy yourself a dream, how's it looking?
Buy yourself a car and a house to live in
Get yourself a girl, someone different
Buy yourself a dream and it won't mean nothing
Closer
Turning it over
It all could be different
Closer
It's time to do something new
I've given everything, oh, to be a happy man
Buy yourself a dream, how's it looking?
Buy yourself a car and a house to live in
Get yourself a girl, someone different
Buy yourself a dream
No, I won't let it tame or twist me
I just got told that I gotta move on
No, I won't let it tame or twist me
I just got told that I gotta move on
